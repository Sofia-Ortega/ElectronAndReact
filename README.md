# Getting Started 

We will be combining React and Electron for this project! To test out this repository, run these commands:

### `yarn install`
Installs all the dependencies you need to work on the project.

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`
Gets your React app up and running on  http://localhost:3000/ 

### `npm run electron-start`


Starts up and electron and opens up an app window.\
Note: only run this command until AFTER **yarn start** has finished running.
  - Electron is grabbing whatever you are running on your localhost and displaying it on your Electron window.
  - Consequences: only an empty screen will show up because it could not grab anything from the localhost.
